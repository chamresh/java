Q1)  Total Expenses for the Event  
The prime functionality of an Event Management System is budgeting. An Event Management System should estimate the total expenses incurred by an event and the percentage rate of each of the expenses involved in planning and executing an event. Nikhil, the founder of "Pine Tree" wanted to include this functionality in his company’s Amphi Event Management System and requested your help in writing a program for the same. 
The program should get the branding expenses, travel expenses, food expenses and logistics expenses as input from the user and calculate the total expenses for an event and the percentage rate of each of these expenses. 

// You are using Java
import java.util.Scanner;
class main
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    
        double brandingExpenses = scanner.nextDouble();
        double travelExpenses = scanner.nextDouble();
        double foodExpenses = scanner.nextDouble();
        double logisticsExpenses = scanner.nextDouble();
        
        double totalExpenses = brandingExpenses + travelExpenses + foodExpenses + logisticsExpenses;
        
        double brandingPercentage = (brandingExpenses / totalExpenses) * 100;
        double travelPercentage = (travelExpenses / totalExpenses) * 100;
        double foodPercentage = (foodExpenses / totalExpenses) * 100;
        double logisticsPercentage = (logisticsExpenses / totalExpenses) * 100;
        
        // Display results
        System.out.println("\nTotal Expenses for the Event: $" + totalExpenses);
        System.out.println("Branding Expenses Percentage: " + brandingPercentage + "%");
        System.out.println("Travel Expenses Percentage: " + travelPercentage + "%");
        System.out.println("Food Expenses Percentage: " + foodPercentage + "%");
        System.out.println("Logistics Expenses Percentage: " + logisticsPercentage + "%");
        
    }

class main
{
   public static void main(String args[])
   {
       Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
       int n=sc.nextInt();
       boolean b[]=new boolean[n];
       int []a=new int[n];
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
       {
           a[i]=sc.nextInt();
       }
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
       {
           if(b[i]==true)
           continue;
           int count=1;
           for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++)
           {
               if(a[i]==a[j])
               {
                   b[j]=true;
                   count++;
               }
           }
           System.out.println(a[i]+" "+count);
       }
   }
}

Q2)  Event Details 
Be it a last-minute get-together, a birthday party or a corporate event, the "Pine Tree" Event Management Company helps you plan and execute it better and faster. Nikhil, the founder of the company wanted the Examly Event Management System to get and display the event details from his Customers for every new order of the Company.   
Write a program that will get the input of the event details like name of the event, type of the event, number of people expected, a string value (Y/N) telling whether the event is going to be a paid entry and the projected expenses (in lakhs) for the event. The program should then display the input values as formatted output. 
	

 
Q12)  Youngest and Oldest 
The Pan Am 73 flight from Bombay to New York en route Karachi and Frankfurt was hijacked by a few Palestinian terrorists at the Karachi International Airport.  
The senior flight purser Neerja Banhot had to wither her fear and start evacuating the passengers on board. She pleaded the hijackers to release the oldest and the youngest person in the aircraft. Heeding to her plea the chief of the hijacker agreed to let go the oldest and the youngest. Given the ages of the passengers find the oldest and the youngest.

Q19)  Finding Next Element 
Problem Description 
Suppose you are working on a text analysis tool for a language learning app. The app provides a sentence in the target language, and the user must translate the sentence into their native language. To help users learn new vocabulary, you decide to include a feature that shows a list of all the unique words in the sentence. Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter a sentence, tokenizes the sentence using the 'StringTokenizer' class, and list out the words in the given sentence

Q4)  The Acme Tennis Ball Company is designing a new box to ship its products. The marketing department wants a triangular box that can hold 4 balls, as in the illustration below. The balls fit exactly inside the box, just touching all three walls and the end caps of the container. All 3 walls of the box are the same size (equilateral triangle). Assume a tennis ball is 6 cm in diameter, and ignore the thickness of the box material. What will be the length and breadth of the material used to make the box? Write a program that finds the measure of a side of the box. Program must also display the length and breadth of the material used to make the triangular box.   
The formula to be applied for the above problem is: 
side = sqrt(3)*diameter 
length = side*3 
breadth = 4*diameter

Q14)  Valid Initial Configuration 
Nurikabe logical game (sometimes called Islands in the Stream) is a binary determination puzzle. The puzzle is played on a typically rectangular grid of cells, some of which contain numbers. You must decide for each cell if it is white or black (by clicking on them) according to the following rules: 
·    All of the black cells must be connected. 
·    Each numbered cell must be part of a white island of connected white cells. 
·    Each island must have the same number of white cells as the number it contains (including the numbered cell). 
·    Two islands may not be connected. 
·    There cannot be any 2x2 blocks of black cells. 
Unnumbered cells start out grey and cycle through white and black when clicked. Initially numbered cells are white in color. 
 Problem Statement: 
 Write a program to check whether the given board configuration is a valid initial configuration. Below figure is the sample valid initial configuration.

Q5)  Grades of Rides  
“AquaticaCarnival” is the most successful event dedicated to children and families. The Event has more than 20 rides for children and adults and the organizers always ensure not to compromise on the safety of the visitors. 
To ensure the safety of the rides, the organizers have graded the rides in the fair according to the following conditions: 
Hurl Factor must be greater than 50. 
Spin Factor must be greater than 60. 
Speed factor must be greater than 100.   
 The grades are as follows: 
 Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met. 
 Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met. 
 Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met. 
 Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met. 
 Garde is 6 if only one condition is met. 
 Grade is 5 if none of three conditions are met.

Q6)  Triangle Game  	
The Westland Game Fair is the premier event of its kind for kids interested in some intellectual and cognitive brain games. Exciting games were organized for kids between age group of 8 and 10. One such game was called the "Triangle game", where different number boards in the range 1 to 180 are available. Each kid needs to select three number boards, where the numbers on the boards correspond to the angles of a triangle.  
If the angles selected by a kid forms a triangle, he/she would receive Prize 1. If the angles selected by a kid forms a right triangle, he/she would receive Prize 2. If the angles selected by the kids form an equilateral triangle, he/she would receive Prize 3. If the angles selected by a kid do not form even a triangle, then he/she will not receive any prizes. Write a program for the organizers to fetch the result based on the number boards selected by the kids.
